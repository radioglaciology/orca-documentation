Antennas are an important part of any radar system, and especially a multi-frequency system like MAPPERR. In a full multi-frequency active-passive configuration, we envision MAPPERR having active radar channels centered at 2, 22, 330, and 1000 MHz, along with passive radiometer channels at 300 and 1000 MHz. We use [these](https://www.ahsystems.com/catalog/SAS-512-2.php) log-periodic dipole array antennas to cover the 300 MHz and above bands. To cover the 2 and 22 MHz channels, we utilize homemade resistively loaded dipoles, each tuned to our desired center frequency.

### Resistively Loaded Dipole Construction
Resistively loaded dipoles are built based on the Wu-King resistive loading method ([Wu and King, 1965](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1138429/)). We use #14 [Flex-Weave^TM^ wire](https://www.davisrf.com/antenna-wire/flexweave.php) from Davis RF to construct our dipoles. Resistors should be rated for the appropriate peak and average power.
