Guidelines for building MAPPERR: a towable, coherent, ground-based, ice-penetrating radar
{{% /pageinfo %}}

At its core MAPPERR, the Multi-frequency Active-Passive Exploration Radar-Radiometer, is a software-defined radio (SDR)-based ice-peentrating radar that runs [Open Radar Code Architecture (ORCA)](/docs/radar/). Operable as a snowmachine-towed radar, MAPPERR is one of the few coherent ground-based ice-penetrating radars that has sufficient flexibilty and low enough cost to be utilized by a wide swath of field-going glaciologists. These pages focus on outlining suggestions for building your own version of MAPPERR. For more information on the architecture of a multi-frequency joint radar-radiometer, we refer you to the following publications:
