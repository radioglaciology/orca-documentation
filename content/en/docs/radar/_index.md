This page contains documentation for Open Radar Code Architecture (ORCA), [available on github](https://github.com/radioglaciology/uhd_radar).

These pages provide a general overview of the ORCA core radar code for interfacing with Ettus SDRs, as well as the main methods available in the ORCA pre-processing and post-processing code. Feel free to browse the code for more nuanced information! Also, check out our paper in IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing that dives into ORCA and its utility for ice-penetrating radar systems. INSERT LINK

The ORCA repository contains a unified set of code for operating coherent, chirped radar systems USRP-based software-defined radios. ORCA was developed by Stanford Radio Glaciology to increase the accesibility of radar sounder instruments in the glaciological community. Most of Stanford Radio Glaciology's USRP-based radar instruments, including MAPPERR and PEREGRINE, run on this code.
