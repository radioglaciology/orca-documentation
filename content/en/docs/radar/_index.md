For a general overview of the ORCA system, we highly recommend reading through
our publication:

{{% readfile "/docs/tgrs_citation.md" %}}

{{% /pageinfo %}}

The documentation is broken into two parts. [Radar Code](/docs/radar/sdr-interface/) covers everything about
the code that runs while the radar is actively collecting data. The
[Postprocessing](/docs/radar/postprocessing/)
section explains how data is saved and explains the basic processing scripts that
we provide.
