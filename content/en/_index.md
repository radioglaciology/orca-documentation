ORCA is a platform for building low-cost, flexible,
and field-proven radar instruments for the cryosphere. ORCA is
the base project for Peregrine, a field-portable ice-penetrating radar UAV,
MAPPERR, a multi-frequency radar/radiometer, and EYAS, a bistatic ice-penetrating radar receiver.

This website provides documentation for the ORCA codebase, along with instructions for building each of these open-source
instruments.

We also provide general strategies for extending our code to develope radar instruments
customized to your research needs.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-gears" title="Software-defined radar code documentation" url="docs/radar" %}}
Our software-defined radar code works with most Ettus USRP software-defined radios.
With a few hardware components and one YAML file, you can build an
ice-penetrating radar system, customized for your research needs.
