ORCA is a platform for building low-cost, flexible,
and field-proven radar instruments for the cryosphere. ORCA is
the base project for Peregrine, a field-portable ice-penetrating radar UAV, and
MAPPERR, a multi-frequency radar/radiometer.

This website provides documentation for building each of these open-source
instruments.

In addition, we provide general strategies for building your own radar instruments
customized to your research needs.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-gears" title="Software-defined radar code documentation" url="docs/radar" %}}
Our software-defined radar code works with most USRP software-defined radios.
With a few hardware components and one YAML file, you can build a customized
ice-penetrating radar system for your research needs.
